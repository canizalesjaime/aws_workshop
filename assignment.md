# Project 1 - Prototype a ChatBot that queries an AWS service

## Learning Objectives
*	Compare different core cloud services and explain how they are used, specifically relating to Compute, Storage, Networking, Database, Security (IAM).
*	Describe the practice of monitoring the health of systems and the impact on application performance, e.g., CPU, Memory, Network I/O, and Disk I/O metrics.
*	Write code to satisfy requirements using fundamental concepts: data structures, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, and/or object-oriented principles.
*	Relate the concept of virtualization to cloud computing, explaining the functionality of resources delivered through the cloud.
*	Demonstrate ability to communicate with stakeholders of different technical depths.

|     You   work at a SaaS company that provides its customers with access to a SaaS   solution.     A large   team of Customer Success Managers (CSMs) have been pinging engineering   regularly to learn about upcoming expected downtime for a core service hosted   on AWS.       Despite   documentation and updated SLAs, the CSMs continue to do it.      It's a   distracting set of messages for Engineers and Engineering Leadership – who   rarely answer within the agreed upon SLA (up to 1 business day).     | **Improved Efficiency:** An automated solution to this problem can provide a self-service way for the customer success teams to check the status of service themselves. <br>**Engineer Productivity:** Frequent interruptions from the customer success team can be disruptive and impact their productivity. A solution to this will help engineers stay focused on their core responsibilities.<br>**The key metric engineering will look to reduce with a solution:** Inquires that gets automatically tracked in Discord. **Success will be defined as follows:**<br>1.	Metric: Number of service status inquiries over time.<br>2.	Before Automation: 50 inquiries per day (constant).<br>3.	After Automation: 30 inquiries per day (declining).<br>                                                             |     Engineering   leadership has tasked you with prototyping an automated Discord bot that can   serve data from the service – hosted on EC2 – that CSMs are constantly asking   about.      An   automated solution will allow Engineering team members to focus on   higher-value tasks, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. In   contrast, messaging engineering may require constant back-and-forth   communication and can be time-consuming.     It   will also allow for reduced the risk of human errors – from misinterpretation   to copy and paste errors - which can lead to costly mistakes and rework.           |

### Summary, Step-by-Step Solution:
1.	Create an EC2 Server with Instance Type: t2.nano and Amazon Linux
2.	SSH into the instance
3.	Python3 should already be installed. Install pip using sudo dnf install python3-pip
4.	Copy the bot.py into the instance
5.	pip3 install python-dotenv discord.py ec2-metadata psutil
6.	Create a Discord server and bot. Add the bot to the server. Make sure Privileged Gateway Intents > Message Content Intent is turned on.
7.	Complete .env file with the Discord bot token.
8.	Run python3 bot.py
9.	Send ‘Tell me about my server!’ in any channel on the Discord server where the bot was added.



# Notes ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
1. psutil is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running 
processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors)

2. ec2_metadata is An easy interface to query the EC2 metadata API (version 2), 
with caching.
